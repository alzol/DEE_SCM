## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 Achievment of Objectives

The chapter "[Physical implementation in a Test Network](5.-physical-implementation-in-a-test-network.md#5-physical-implementation-in-a-test-network)" shows how the basis of the [MVP ](5.-physical-implementation-in-a-test-network.md#5-1-minimum-viable-product)was built up. We were able to set up the private Ehereum blockchain with two nodes and three miners at the beginning of the [hackathon ](2.-theoretical-background.md#2-1-hackathon)and to ensure the communication. The sample scenario in the [previous chapter](6.-structure-of-the-smart-contract.md#6-1-sample-scenario) shows how far the technical implementation of the MVP has come during the course of the hackathon. The sample scenario was implemented and it is possible to comprehend which party buys energy from which provider. Furthermore, it can be seen from the screenshots and the sequence diagram, that the functions related to the transfer of the ether could be implemented as well. Thus, the first part of the MVP has been implemented. It is safe to say, that the team could reach their set goal.

In order to implement all requirements, the second part of the MVP would have to be analyzed in more detail, implemented and tested. This was not done during the hackathon, but remains as a future task.

### 7.2 Reflection

During the course of the hackathon, we stumbled across various problems or obstacles. One of them is, that the given use case is very complex and the only ones having previous knowledge about the energy sector were the students working on the business use case and its documentation. This made the implementation and the communication between the teams very difficult and misleading. It was hard to create a common understanding and a basis everybody could start from, because the business students did not have knowledge about the technical aspects. Another problem we encountert was regarding the available hardware. Since the miners need a lot of ressources, we decided to run them on our laptops. However the laptops were fully occupied by the miners, altough some of the laptops were running in the newest and currently most powerful i5 processors. Because of this, three of our team members could not work properly while the blockchain was running, and that at the already very tight time. Since we were able to estimate at the beginning that the time is closely calculated, we had to divide the MVP into two parts of which we only could work on one. The fact that three laptops were running the blockchain did contribute to the time running out before we could start with working on the second part of the MVP.
