# 5. Physical implementation in a Test Network

### 5.1         The Test Network

To deploy a smart contract in a Blockchain, a Blockchain has first to be setup. The created test Network consisted of 5 nodes: 3 aktive miners and 2 passive nodes. The 3 Miners were setup on the more powerfull notebooks while the remaining 2 nodes were installed on the Raspberry PiÂ´s.

### 5.1.1 **Used Hardware**

For testing, three laptops were set up as miners and two Raspberrys Pi 3 as nodes.

### 5.1.2 Install an Ethereum node on a Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pis were chosen because they are cheap and easy to set up compared to laptops or computers. Also, the computing power should be sufficient to operate a node.

The Raspberry Pi has been assembled according to the instructions included in the box and has a USB mouse and USB keyboard connected. A screen was connected via HDMI cable and a LAN cable was plugged in. After the installation they were operated via WLAN.

The installation of the Raspberrys was done according to the instructions of [ChainSkills](http://chainskills.com/2017/02/24/create-a-private-ethereum-blockchain-with-iot-devices-16/). This series of tutorials describes how to set up a private Ethereum blockchain that will be composed of a computer \(miner\) and one or several Raspberry PI 3 devices \(nodes\).

The setup of the Raspberry Pi requires the following hardware:

* A Raspberry Pi
* An SD Card with at least 16Gb
* A LAN cable
* A keyboard
* A display

**Steps to perform**

* Format the SD-Card in FAT32.
* Download the Raspbian image and write it to the SD-Card .
* Make our preferred adjustments \(language, tastatur layout, Wi-Fi, SSH\).
* Connect via PuTTY.
* Install and run [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).

### 5.1.3 Install an Ethereum miner on a computer and initializing the blockchain

For the installation of the Ethereum miners on Windows computers, we followed the instruction of [ChainSkills](http://chainskills.com/2017/03/03/install-a-ethereum-node-on-a-computer-26/). 

**Steps to perform**

* Installation of [Geth ](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/)
* Initialization of a private Blockchain with our [genesis.json](https://github.com/Ricardo-Cz/DEE_SCM/blob/master/genesis.json) file for each miner.
* Creation of accounts for each miner and node.
* Preparation of each miner with our [start parameters](https://github.com/Ricardo-Cz/DEE_SCM/blob/master/startminer1.bat).
* Testing of each miner.
* Deleting the private Blockchain of each miner.
* Pairing and synchronizing of the three miners by configuring our [static-nodes.json](https://github.com/Ricardo-Cz/DEE_SCM/blob/master/static-nodes.json) parameters. \(Hardest step.\)
* Pairing and Synchronizing the Raspberry PIs with our miners by configuring our [static-nodes.json ](https://github.com/Ricardo-Cz/DEE_SCM/blob/master/static-nodes.json)parameters.
* Connecting to our mining network via [Mist browser](https://github.com/ethereum/mist).
